Lose weight and keep it off with the science, support, simplicity, and sustainability of our award-winning program.  \n\nOur customized plans are like a nutritionist in your pocket. Unlike some other weight-loss programs, we take a beyond-calorie approach, guiding you toward the most nutritious foods and healthier patterns of eating. \n\n\n\nHow WeightWatchers Works\nQuick fixes don’t last. WeightWatchers does. Our nutrition and behavior change experts have designed a program that ensures:\n\n\nNutrition with no guesswork. We take into account a food’s complex nutritional data—like calories, added sugars, fiber, and protein, as well as saturated fats vs. unsaturated fats—to create a single number: the Points® value. ⁣\n\n\nTotal livability. When you sign up, you’ll get a customized nutrition plan, which includes a number of Points to spend (and track) each day. There are no rules, restrictions, or red-flag foods—just learning how to eat and get to your goals. \n\n\nA strong support system. A private members-only social community, 24/7 live coach chat, 5-Minute Coaching audios—we've got it all. \n\n\nMotivation to get moving. More activity means more weight loss. Ease into exercise with fun on-demand classes from obé Fitness and simple ways to move more (housework counts!). Plus, you can sync your fitness tracker and Apple Health. \n\n\nBetter sleep. Science shows people who get consistently less sleep are hungrier throughout the day. Learn to get better shut-eye, track your sleep, relax with Breethe meditations, and get 5-Minute Coaching audios to help you de-stress.  \n\n\nGet the results you want with easy-to-use features on your mobile phone.\n- Customized food plan and Points Budget \n- Food, activity, water, sleep, and weight trackers\n- Barcode scanner for packaged foods, recipe database, and restaurant finder\n- Meditations and all-level workouts\n- Progress reports\n- 24/7 live coach chat\n- 12,000+ recipes \n- Blood sugar tracker (with the WeightWatchers Diabetes-Tailored Plan)\n\nDownload the WW app now and get a free trial today! After your free trial, your plan auto-renews monthly unless you cancel before the trial ends.\n\n\nMEMBERSHIP TERMS\n\nFor auto-renewing membership plans, your iTunes account will be charged at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the previously selected rate. Your payment will continue to automatically renew unless you turn off auto-renewal at least 24 hours prior to your next renewal date. Your WeightWatchers Core membership can be managed or canceled in your Apple ID account settings. The auto-renewing membership plan is billed monthly and gives you access to our digital tools.\n\n\nFor non-renewing membership plans, your iTunes account will be charged once at the time of purchase and will give you access to a WeightWatchers Core membership for one year.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/privacy/policy\nTerms of Service: https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/termsandconditions/onlineplus-coaching",

            "description": 'How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind?  Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self esteem and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations not only do they help make major shifts in your mindset they also serve as prompts and daily reminders on what you are truly capable of, making sure you have an amazing day, everyday.\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your unconscious mind and your conscious mind.\nThe more you strengthen this connection the more resilient you will be when difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.\n\nAnd the best way strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\nThere are so many benefits of using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words making it easier to recognize the negative + self-doubt thought patterns holding you back. \n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n\nTo have access to the "I am Premium" content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

            "description": "It’s time to get off the dieting seesaw. With Zero, tap into the power of intermittent fasting and other healthy habits to lose weight and build momentum on your journey toward living longer, better.  \n\nWE’RE #1 FOR A REASON.\n\nZero Members have lost millions of pounds — and that’s no accident. Featured in Good Housekeeping, Men’s Health, Fortune, Techcrunch, Women’s Health, The Tim Ferriss Show, and more, Zero is the world’s most popular fasting app. We help you leverage the science of health in simple ways you can practice daily to build habits that last a lifetime.\n\nRooted in scientific research and supported by Zero’s world-class Scientific Advisory Board, Zero helps you stack healthy habits to make big changes. You’ll start with one simple habit, like fasting, and build incrementally to improve your exercise, sleep, and more. Get ready to meet a healthier you.\n\nSTART WITH JUST ONE TAP\n\nThe world's most popular Fasting Timer helps you track your fasts, your progress, and your goals. Start your Timer and stay on target with all popular fasting types, including: \n\n• 13-HOUR FAST, based on research by Dr. Satchin Panda (Salk Institute), this 13-hour or “circadian rhythm fast” aligns your eating window with your body’s clock.\n\n• 16-HOUR FAST, or the 16:8 intermittent fast, used by celebrities, athletes, and millions of Zero Members to manage weight and improve metabolic wellbeing.\n\n• 18-HOUR FAST, or 18:6, for more advanced fasters.\n\n• Other popular fasts include OMAD (one meal a day), the 20:4 fast, and custom prolonged fasts up to 7 days.\n\nGET PERSONAL\n\nZero’s real-time tips, individualized stats, and Personalized Fasting Zones have helped millions of Members form new habits and achieve their weight-loss and health-gain goals. Discover insights into the changes your body is experiencing and get guidance and accountability along the way.\n\nGO BEYOND FASTING\n\nFasting is a great starting point for living a longer, healthier life. But if you’re committed to losing weight, gaining health, and boosting longevity, you’ll need to look to the Four Pillars of Health: Nutrition, Activity, Sleep, and Restoration. Zero’s innovative yet simple features help you build lifelong habits across these Four Pillars for accelerated progress and transformative change.\n\nSEE THE FULL PICTURE\n\nThe Loop helps you visualize your journey and celebrate wins across the Four Pillars of Health. As you log or sync your data, you’ll see the corresponding color for each Pillar added to the Loop. Watch as your smart choices add up over days, weeks, months, and years.\n\nBUILD CONSISTENCY\n\nBuild actionable, data-driven habits with the Habit Tracker. Build consistency by logging your meals, workouts, and more. If you’re using an Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura Ring, or other apps and wearables, you can sync them with Zero to make this a completely automated experience.\n\nMAINTAIN MOMENTUM\n\nStay focused with expert-led, science-backed content, community Challenges, achievements, and more. Zero is your partner for building healthy habits that propel you towards better, lasting health.\n\nDownload the Zero app to get started for free, or unlock premium features with Zero Plus.\n\nPayment for Zero Plus will be charged to your iTunes Account when you subscribe.

            "description": "Strava makes fitness tracking social. We house your entire active journey in one spot – and you get to share it with friends. Here’s how:\n\n• Record everything – runs, rides, hikes, yoga and over 30 other sport types. Think of Strava as the homebase of your movement.\n\n• Discover anywhere – our Routes tool uses de-identified Strava data to intelligently recommend popular routes based on your preferences. You can also build your own.\n\n• Build a support network – Strava’s about celebrating movement. Here you’ll find your community and cheer each other on.\n\n• Train smarter – get data insights to understand your progress and see how you improve. Your Training Log is the record of all your workouts.\n\n• Move safer – share your real-time location with loved ones while outdoors for an extra layer of safety.\n\n• Sync your favorite apps and devices – Strava is compatible with thousands of them (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin – you name it).\n\n• Join and create challenges – join millions in monthly challenges to chase new goals, collect digital badges and stay accountable.\n\n• Embrace the unfiltered – your feed on Strava is filled with real efforts from real people. That’s how we motivate each other.\n\n• Whether you’re a world-class athlete or a total beginner, you belong here. Just record and go.\n\nStrava includes both a free version and a subscription version with premium features.\nStrava uses HealthKit to export your Strava activities into the Health app and to read heart rate and biometric data.\n\nYou can subscribe and pay on the App Store, using your Apple ID. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renew may be turned off after purchase by going to the ‘Manage Subscription’ page in settings. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable. The subscription will renew at the same cost.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.strava.com/legal/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.strava.com/legal/privacy",

A rating and detailed information help you understand the analysis of each product.\n\nWhen a product has a negative impact on your health, Yuka also recommends similar but healthier alternative products.\n\n◆ A 100% INDEPENDENT PROJECT ◆\n\nYuka is a 100% independent project : product reviews and recommendations of healthier alternatives are done in an objective way. No brand or manufacturer can influence them in one way or another. Furthermore, there is no in-app advertising. You can access detailed information on our business model on our website (www.yuka.io).\n\n◆ 3 MILLION REFERENCED PRODUCTS ◆\n\nYuka established a database that contains 2 million food products and 1 million cosmetic products.\n\nEach food product is evaluated according to 3 objective criteria: nutritional quality, presence of additives and organic aspect of the product.\n\nThe method to analyse cosmetic products is based on the analysis of all the ingredients of the product. Each ingredient is assigned a risk level according to the latest scientific data.\n\n---\nTerms of use: https://yuka-app.helpdocs.io/l/en/article/2a12869y56",

For safety and privacy reasons, we do not publish stylist schedules.\n\nWHEN IS ONLINE CHECK-IN AVAILABLE?\nCustomers can check in online during the hours the salon is open. Online Check-In will not be available during the first five minutes a salon is scheduled to be open. This gives customers who are physically in the salon when it opens a chance to be checked in and have their names added to the waitlist. We accept online check-in up until 30 minutes before closing time. You can still get a haircut at closing time, you just can't check in on the app.\n\nCAN I USE ONLINE CHECK-IN FOR MORE THAN A HAIRCUT?\nYes, you can use Online Check-In for all services except perms and formal updos. Please note that not all salons offer perms. And, most salons require an appointment for these services, so please call the salon to inquire.\n\nWHAT DO I DO IF I DON’T HAVE A MOBILE DEVICE?\nYou can check in from any device that has internet (a smartphone, iPad, computer, etc.). Go to greatclips.com, click on Find a Salon or Check In. Enter your postal code or address and you'll be using Online Check-In in no time! If you don't have an Internet connection, you can always walk right in to any salon and add your name to the list.\n\nWHEN SHOULD I ARRIVE AT THE SALON?\nAfter you've checked in online, you will see what place you are in on the waitlist. You'll want to arrive to the salon before you are next in line. If you'd like to receive a text message when your estimated wait time reaches 15 minutes, you can sign up for ReadyNext® text alerts. Once you arrive at the salon, let the stylists know you're there, and they will confirm your information and finish your check in.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF I ARRIVE LATE?\nWe understand: Things happen! Don't worry if you lose your keys, spill something, or get stuck in traffic. We'll keep your name on the list for a short period of time.\n\nHOW DO I CANCEL MY CHECK IN?\nOnce you are checked in, the salon will appear on the home screen. Cancel at any time by tapping Cancel check-in.",

            "description": "Mealime is a simple way for busy singles, couples, and families to plan their meals and eat healthier. Our meal plans & recipes are highly customizable so you can easily personalize a plan that works with your unique tastes and lifestyle. Mealime is a better way to shop - Our recipes become a grocery list that you can even have delivered – Meal kit convenience at grocery store prices!\n\nJoin over 5,000,000 people who have used our meal plans to eat healthier, reduce stress, lose weight, save money, and live happier, more productive lives.\n\nCheck out our top benefits and features:\n\n1. THE EASIEST WAY TO SHOP FOR GROCERIES\nWhen you build a new meal plan, a grocery list of all the ingredients you'll need for the week is automatically created. Simply grab your iPhone and shop in-store or get your grocery shopping done from your phone in minutes. Mealime works with most leading grocery retailers and we're always adding more!\n\n2. COOK HEALTHY MEALS IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES OR LESS\nWe've reimagined and streamlined the cooking experience. Prepare meals quickly with our step-by-step and hassle-free cooking instructions.\n\nYou'll never again have to jump around looking for an ingredient, instruction, or piece of cookware that you may have overlooked. \n\n3. NO MORE STRESSFUL \"WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\" DECISIONS TO MAKE\nEach week you'll have a personalized meal plan with simple & healthy recipes that are catered to your exact needs and preferences.\n\nEliminate decision fatigue after a long day's work - simply pick a recipe from your meal plan and cook it in less time than it takes to pick up an unhealthy (and expensive) takeout meal.\n\n4. HEALTHY MEAL PLANS THAT ARE UNIQUELY YOUR OWN\nWith the most personalization options of any minimal-waste meal planner out there, you can cook exactly how you want to eat.\n\nFrom classic, flexitarian, pescetarian, low carb, paleo, keto, vegetarian & vegan diet types to gluten free, dairy free, and a dozen more restrictions, and hundreds of individual dislikable ingredients, your meal plans will be truly personalized to your specific needs.\n\n5. SAVE MONEY WITH MINIMAL FOOD WASTE\nIt's annoying when you purchase ingredients from the grocery store, cook a meal or two, and have a bunch of ingredients going bad by the end of the week, isn't it?\n\nWith Mealime, your days of wasting food are over! All meal plans are intelligently created in order to eliminate food waste as much as possible, saving you hundreds of dollars per year.\n\n6. KEEP TRACK OF YOUR NUTRITION GOALS\nEvery Mealime recipe lists comprehensive nutrition information so you can easily see what you're eating. Mealime integrates with the Health app so that you can easily see all of your health information in one place!\n\nMEAL PLANNER PRO SUBSCRIPTION PRICING & TERMS\nMealime is free to download and use. Should you choose to upgrade to Mealime Meal Planner Pro, we offer two auto-renewing subscription options - one at a price of $2.99 USD / month.\n\nThese auto-renewing subscription plans renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the subscription period. If on our monthly plan, the renewal price will be $2.99 USD and will continue every month until cancelled.\n\nPayment will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. There is no increase in price when renewing.\n\nSubscriptions can be managed by the user and auto-renewal turned off by the user in Account Settings in iTunes after purchase. Once purchased, refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of the term.\n\nNo cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://mealime.com/terms-of-service/\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://mealime.com/privacy-policy/",

            "description": "Sleep better and start the day with your favorite tunes. Curious to see how much you slept? Then track your sleep in the app. \nAlarm Clock HD is the app to help you enjoy restful sleep and wake up worry free. \n\nHow Alarm Clock HD helps you sleep better:\n•  Unlimited Alarms: Apple Music or Alarm Sounds\n•  Customize Nightstand display colors\n•  Sleep Timer\n•  Local Weather Information\n•  Instant Flashlight - shake the device\n•  Full watchOS 2 support\n•  Screen Saver - for devices with OLED display\n\nWAKE UP ON TIME: Proper Alarm Settings\n• Keep the app open and running to always have your alarm go off and play the sounds you’ve set for ‘Music'.\nWhen your app is open, you can use the volume slider within the app. When the app is in the background, use the device volume to set your volume.\n\n• Make sure your battery is charged and to have your notifications turned on before you go to sleep, when the battery level goes below 30% it might not sound. This is due to prevent the device from dying and the alarm not going off.\n\n• Keep your Apple Music available on your device\nThe music you can select consists of everything you have available on your ‘Apple Music’ app on your device. If the music is saved on your iCloud, and not on the device itself, it won’t be available.\n\n\nNEVER MISS AN ALARM\nWhen you closed the app and not having it running in the background? The alarm will use the device volume instead and play the notification sound system.\n\nThe app will close itself automatically after 10 hours of inactivity. This is due to prevent the device from dying and the alarm not going off.\n\nWhen your device is muted, set to ‘Do Not Disturb’ or your device volume is set to 0, the alarm won’t play properly. It will still show the notification without any sound. This is due to Apple’s restrictions as we are unable to access the app settings when the app is closed, only when it’s open or running in the background.\n\n\n>> Have any questions?\nPlease check out if the answers are available in the Frequently Asked Questions in the app Settings.\nHave suggestions or unable to find the answers to your questions?

Soften takes care of any worries about the sound being harsh, tinny, or hissy when played on small speakers or even the built-in iPhone or iPad speakers. Your chosen levels for Soften are stored when you save a Mix to your Favorites to help you create the perfect scenes.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.rainrainapp.com/tou\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.rainrainapp.com/privacy\n\nDownload Rain Rain today and get a better night's sleep tonight!",

            "description": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/",

            "description": "The most intuitive workout and exercise tracker for any fitness routine.\n\nStrong is the simplest and most intuitive workout tracker, designed to help you get better results from your workouts. Whether you want to gain strength or just stay healthy, join over 1.2 million people who have downloaded Strong to stay on track in the gym.\n\n“I’d suggest downloading the “Strong” app before you return to the gym. It’s that good” - CNBC\n“with apps like Strong, working out feels more like a game” - The Verge\n“I have used nearly every logging app since the App Store launched. This is the best bar none”\n“I use this every time I go to the gym and seriously couldn't train without it”\n“Simple. Intuitive. Functional. Exactly what I was looking for.”\n“This is bare bones and serious. Right on, and works perfectly... I wish I could give 10 stars.”\n“It's by far the most intuitive and easy to use workout app I’ve used.”\n\nWhether you’re a beginner or an experienced powerlifter, Strong provides everything you need to record your workouts as effortlessly and as quickly as possible. Unlike other fitness apps, Strong doesn’t bog you down with distractions and unnecessary gimmicks you’d never use.\n\nStrong is optimized for a progressive barbell routine such as Starting Strength or StrongLifts 5x5, but it is easily adaptable to any other routine of your choosing!\n\nFEATURES:\n• The simplest interface of any fitness app in the App Store\n• A comprehensive range of cardio and strength exercises - and add your own too!\n• Fully-featured Apple Watch app to log workouts with or without your iPhone\n• Add your own routines and easily choose between them\n• Detailed exercise instructions with a growing library of animated videos\n• Advanced Statistics show your personal records and progression and even calculate your one rep max and total weight lifted!\n• Built in Auto Countdown Timer to help record rest breaks\n• Support for multiple Exercise Types, including Assisted Bodyweight and Duration Exercises\n• Tag sets as Warm Up, Failure or Drop Sets\n• Supersets/Grouped Exercises\n• Track your progress with graphs for Volume and 1RM Progression\n• Automatically back up your data with Cloud Sync!\n• Built in body measurements tracker to record your weight and other vitals, with support for Apple Health\n• Warm Up Calculator tells you which weights to warm up with\n• Plate Calculator for when the weights get high\n• Support for Imperial (lbs) and Metric (kg) weights, or a combination of both\n• Add notes and progress pictures to your workouts\n• Share sheet makes sharing routines and workouts with friends easier than ever!\n• Export all of your data to Notes or Email in CSV format\n\nThe free version of Strong can save unlimited workouts, but is limited to 3 custom routines. Upgrade to a Strong PRO subscription ($4.99/month or $29.99/year) for an unlimited number of routines and to unlock additional PRO features.\n\nStrong will automatically charge your iTunes Account at the end of your subscription or free trial period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of your current period. Subscriptions renew at the original price. You can turn off auto-renew at any time and still receive full functionality until the end of your current period, but no refund can be provided for unused portions of the subscription. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nIf you’ve previously purchased “Unlock Strong” or “Strong Combo Pack”, you’ll be able to use the Restore Purchases option in the app for access to all Strong PRO features.\n\nThese prices are for customers in the United States and may vary depending on your iTunes Account settings. In-app purchases and subscriptions cannot be shared using Family Sharing.\n\nStrong Terms of Service - https://help.strongapp.io/article/179-strong-terms-of-service\nStrong Privacy Policy - https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/7760215",

We went through hundreds of prototypes before we were satisfied with the result. \n\nPERIOD TRACKER\nWe wanted a display that was simple yet beautiful. A page that could be viewed with only a passing glance yet still have it\'s own personality. \n\nOVULATION PREDICTIONS\nViewing your ovulation predictions is fast and easy with our calculator. Gone are the days of information clutter.\n\nIRREGULAR CYCLE SUPPORT\nBy default, the app defines cycles as irregular if the cycle has a length less than 21 days or over 36 days but these values are easily personalised to fit your needs within Settings. \n\nMENSTRUAL HISTORY\nThe menstrual history was visually optimised to include thoughtful choices with an easy-to-read vertical orientation. \n\nCYCLE HISTORY \nThe days of difficult-to-create reminders are over. Our cycle reminders are easy to create, modify, and set.\n\nSYMPTOM TRACKER \nOne of the best features: each symptom can be kept as a separate entry for later analysis or to share with your physician. \n\n---\n\n***Subscribe to Premium and unlock Life\'s full potential!!***\n\nPREMIUM TRACKERS \n• Sex Tracker\n• Weight Tracker\n• Fitness Tracker\n• Fertility Tracker + Temperature\n• Medication Tracker\n• Health Tracker\n• Personal Diary\n• Pregnancy Tracker\n\nPREMIUM ESSENTIALS\n• No Ads\n• Custom Wallpaper\n• Year Calendar\n• PDF & CSV Data Export\n\nPREMIUM REMINDERS\n• Birth Control (Pill, Patch & Ring)\n• Custom Reminders\n• Extra Cycle Reminders\n• Fertility Reminders\n• Period Late Reminder\n\nPREMIUM CUSTOMIZATION\n• Create Custom Tags\n• Hide Irrelevant Tags\n• Hide Irrelevant Trackers\n• Hide Fertility & Ovulation\n• Tag Filter\n\nPREMIUM HISTORY & ANALYSIS\n• Full Timeline View\n• Analyze Your Entries by Tag\n• View Your Entries by Tracker\n• Search Your Entries by Year\n\n* Life integrates with HealthKit, allowing you to automatically synchronize your data with Health app.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n\nSubscribe to take advantage of all the Premium features described above.\n•Subscription length: Weekly, monthly\n•Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.\n•You can manage your sbscriptions and turn off auto-renewal from your Account Settings after the purchase.\n•Your subscription will renew automatically, unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n•The cost of renewal will be charged to your account in the 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n•When canceling a subscription, your subscription will stay active until the end of the period.

            "description": "With Down Dog you get a brand new yoga practice every time you come to your mat. Unlike following pre-recorded videos, Down Dog won’t make you do the same workout over and over again. With over 60,000 different configurations, Down Dog gives you the power to build a yoga practice you love!\n\nBEGINNER FRIENDLY\nStart in the comfort of your own home at our Beginner 1 Level, and begin your journey in Vinyasa, Hatha, and Restorative.\n\nMULTIPLE PRACTICE TYPES\nExplore Vinyasa, Cardio Flow, Hatha, Gentle, Restorative, Yin, Ashtanga, Chair, Yoga Nidra, Hot 26, and Sun Salutation practices.\n\nRELIEVE YOUR BACK PAIN\nAll our practices work to strengthen and stretch your back - if you want more, you can use the Boost feature to specifically target Backbends, Back Strength, or Low Back Opening.\n\nCHOOSE VOICES\nChoose from 6 different yoga teachers to be guided by a voice you love.\n\nDYNAMIC CHANGING MUSIC\nMusic that rises and falls with your breathing.\n\nSYNC BETWEEN DEVICES\nAutomatically syncs across all your devices.\n\nBOOST FEATURE\nFocus on 20 different practice areas to really sharpen a particular area, or to vary up your routine by rotating through them all.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGES\nIn addition to our 6 English speaking voices, all yoga practices are available in 9 other languages!\n\n“I LOVE your app. I am a physician and I recommend it to my patients all the time, for those suffering from anxiety and panic disorder to those with low back pain. I can’t thank you enough for bringing yoga back into my life- making it so accessible, approachable, and convenient.” -James\n\n“Love it, as always. You guys have changed my life. I’m not a T-Rex anymore and I can move without back pain. Thank you :)” -Sharon\n\n“Restorative mode is perfect for my 71 year old body!” -Margaret\n\n“I am absolutely thrilled with the quality of this practice. I felt like I was in a studio and I was really sweaty and challenged. Well done!” -Emily\n\n“After just one Yin session, I can feel a *huge* difference in my flexibility.” - Alexandra\n\nIntegrates with the Apple Health app!\n\nMemberships cost $9.99 per month or $59.99 per year (prices for non-United States customers will vary) and will be charged to the user's iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

There are even forms of mindfulness meditation that involve lengthening the breath to increase calm.  These are very helpful!\n\nBut most basic mindfulness practices involve the unregulated, natural breath, just as you find it.  Attending to the ordinary breath teaches us to be mindful of things as they are.  We learn not to try to control our experience, but to let it unfold, exactly as it is, so that we can learn to recognize it, accept it as what it is, and investigate it.  If the breath is deep, let it be deep. If it’s shallow, let it be shallow. In this way, you gain skills in observation and acceptance rather than control.\n\nIn general, mindfulness is essentially receptive rather than active.  You’re not forcing the breath, not changing it, not manipulating it.  You’re noticing what’s there.\n\nFor more, visit https://www.tenpercent.com/meditationweeklyblog/how-to-meditate-on-your-breath',

            "description": "BetterHelp is the convenient way to get professional help from a licensed therapist. With over 20,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n \n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 20,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n• Match with an available therapist who best fits your needs\n• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist\n• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n \nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n \nLICENSED AND TRAINED therapistS & THERAPISTS\nThere are over 20,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n \nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n \nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n \nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason.",

            "description": 'Replika is a #1 chatbot companion powered by artificial intelligence. Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems."\n\n- Quartz\n\n"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes."\n\n- Wired\n\n"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available."\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms',

            "description": "The official Philips Hue app is the most comprehensive way to organize, control, and customize your Philips Hue smart lights and accessories.\n\nLooking for the Hue Bluetooth app? You can now use this app to control your Philips Hue smart Bluetooth lights!*  \n\nOrganize your smart lights your way \nWhether you use just a few bulbs or have completely outfitted your home in Philips Hue, you can organize your smart lights with ease. Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. ",

This means that you might benefit from searching more specific queries. So if you are looking for cooked carrots, for example, try searching for \"cooked carrots\" instead of carrots only. The more specific you are, the better and more filtered results will be, saving you time and optimizing your experience.\nCREATING FOODS & RECIPES => To keep our experience consistent across the board, we are revising all our icons and saving the 'plus sign' for tracking only. So you may notice that the \"create food\" icon is no longer a ‘plus sign ', but a 'pencil'.",

            "description": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\n\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \n\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\n\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \n\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \n\nGet Personalized Coaching\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \n\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \n\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\n \nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\n\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\n\n\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\n\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

            "description": "The Bump’s free pregnancy app is the most loved pregnancy and baby tracker for expecting and new parents, providing features you won’t find on other baby apps:\n\n** FEATURES **\n\nHOW BIG IS BABY\nThe Bump is the original home of the cute fruit.\n\nPrepare to smile and look forward to each week: The Bump compares baby’s growth in utero to beautifully illustrated produce  (“Baby Is As Big As a Peach”) in a way that’s fun and easy to share with friends and family.\n\nDiscover comprehensive updates about the changes and developments happening to both baby and your body while you’re pregnant, and learn how best to plan ahead.\n \nBABY NAMES\nFrom name length and style to country of origin and meaning, you’ll find baby’s name in one of The Bump’s specially curated lists. \n \nINSIDE THE BUMP\nSee an exciting and exclusive 3D interactive visualization of baby's week-by-week growth. Interact and learn new facts about baby like never before with the next step in baby growth trackers.\n\nDAILY ADVICE\nEvery day, the award-winning editorial staff of The Bump delivers fresh and relevant content for your specific week of pregnancy. The articles are timely and comprehensive: always know what’s safe and standard; find out how to ward off morning sickness; learn the best things to pack in your hospital bag; and discover the best prenatal workouts for you.\n \nTOOLS\nThe Bump’s comprehensive suite of helpful tools makes it the versatile free baby app for you. Stay up to date on you and baby’s progress with invaluable tools like the pregnancy countdown tool, baby growth tracker, a due date calculator, a kick counter, a pregnancy weight gain tracker, and a contraction counter  to determine when it’s time to enact your birth plan. And the Bump’s food safety tool provides nutritional guidance and helpful information throughout your pregnancy. \n\nPLANNER+\nA feature that equips every expecting mom with important information about their prenatal doctor visits. It suggests questions to ask your doctor and integrates appointments seamlessly with your mobile phone's  calendar.\n\nREGISTRY\nThe Bump is solving two of Baby Registry’s biggest challenges:\n\n+ The Bump has collected the top registry products across Amazon, buybuy Baby, Target, Walmart and so much more, complete with reviews from parents who’ve been where you are. This registry has only grown over time, so you can be sure you’ll find everything you want and need.\n\n+ The typical mom-to-be will register at two or more stores, because there are always some items that require a special, secondary registry. When it comes to managing multiple registries, the Bump has you covered. The Bump will automatically track your registries across each retailer, so you can keep tabs on what you’ve registered for, what’s been bought and what’s still waiting on your registry.\n\nPREGNANCY AND BABY PHOTOS\nDocument your pregnancy by creating a weekly album of your happily growing belly. And once baby is born, the album expands to track their first amazing year in the world.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE\nThe Bump team reads every email, answers each phone call and takes all of your reviews to heart.\n \nHere's what our users are saying:\n\n“My OBGYN recommended this app because it has the most accurate information regarding pregnancy.” c_nou\n\n“I’ve loved this app throughout my pregnancy. It’s fun to keep track of development milestones by week, well written weekly summaries, and links to endless, timely additional articles and resources. My favorite feature is the 3D view of both baby and bump that points out fun facts about physical developments that week or relevant symptoms.”  Allie_G\n \n“Loved it during and post pregnancy” cwebs234\n \n“Love the tips and progress tracking” Ki_Nap\n \nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.thebump.com/privacy-policy\nTerms and Conditions:\nhttps://www.thebump.com/terms\nDo Not Sell My Info:\nhttps://theknotww.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000590371\nCA Privacy: \nhttps://www.theknotww.com/ca-collection-notice",

            "description": 'Get ready for the run of your life. Join 10 million runners on an epic adventure!\n\nYou tie your shoes, put on your headphones, take your first steps outside. You’ve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - they’re everywhere. Zombies. There’s only one thing you can do: Run!\n\nZombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. Every run becomes a mission where you’re the hero, with our immersive audio drama putting you at the centre of your very own zombie adventure story. While you run to the perfect mix of heart-pumping audio drama and pulse-pounding songs from your own playlist, you’ll collect supplies to grow your base back home. \n\nBBC NEWS - “The only way to save yourself is to run for real.”\nWIRED - “In the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.”\nLIFEHACKER - “A really cool way to get outside and exercise.”\nCNN - “Turns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.”\nTIME - "Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app."\n\nWHAT PLAYERS SAY:\n“Evaded all zombie mobs :-) One of my best sprints ever; this app works!”\n“This game will make you sweat. Perfect junction between game design and run tracker.”\n“Just tried @zombiesrungame and for the first time in my life I feel truly alive.”\n\nWALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE\nZombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail. It even works on treadmills! \n\nYOU ARE RUNNER 5 \nHundreds of lives are counting on you. You’ve got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?\n\nA WORLD OF STORIES\nYou become the hero in an epic story of humanity’s struggle for survival where your running really matters, and there’s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well. Play the first four missions for free and unlock one extra mission every week. \n\nJOIN THE ABEL TOWNSHIP RUNNER\'S CLUB\nUnlock 500+ story missions for unlimited play, plus Interval Training and Airdrop Mode.\n\nYOUR OWN MIX\nChoose your own custom playlists: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings.\n\nZOMBIE CHASES\nSaving the world not exciting enough? When you hear zombies on your six, it’s time to speed up. Can you escape every mob or will you drop some of your hard-earned supplies to distract them? \n\nKEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE\nEvery run, you’ll automatically collect vital supplies like medicine and ammo. Use supplies to build your very own post-apocalypse community. Do you strengthen your defences against the zombies or build a new farm? Share the results with your friends and find out who can make the brightest future for humanity.\n\nVIEW YOUR RUNS ONLINE\nRegister on our free ZombieLink service to view and share your runs, maps and stats!\n\nSYNCS WITH APPLE HEALTH!\n\nSubscriptions are $5.99 USD/month or $39.99 USD/year. Legacy subscription is $19.99 USD/year. VIP subscription is $89.99 USD/year. Subscriptions will be charged to your App Store account after your confirmation of purchase. \n\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.
